# How to contribute

To ensure q is stable on as many platforms as possible and progresses
quickly, patches and pull requests are highly welcome. Any method of
communication is fine to talk about issues, features and implementation.
I am happy to help out if you stumble upon problems, try slack for
unstructured discussions. The easiest way to get in touch with the author
is:

 * Slack (link in [README.md](README.md))
 * PR's
 * Issues

The codebase is pretty strict in terms of coding style, please try to
follow it. In any case, I will take the freedom to alter contributions
until they fit with the rest of the code.

# Transferred copyright

The copyright of contributed code will have to be transferred to me. By
contributing and sending pull requests you accept this.

The reason for this is to enable future re-licensing to other licenses,
without having to ask for permission from every contributor. The reason for
re-licensing is to make q (or part of q) fit in other projects, such as
standard libraries, boost, etc.

Although the ownership of the code must be transferred, your contributions
will be added to a list of contributors (except if you whish they not be).
